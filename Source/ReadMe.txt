Welcome!
--------
This zip file contains the source code for my book "Comprehensive VB .NET Debugging".

The sample code provided has been tested using the last RC of Visual Studio 2003 and version 1.1 of the .NET Framework. It has also been tested using Visual Studio 2002 and version 1.0 of the .NET Framework. 


--------------------------
To extract the source code
--------------------------
Use any zip program - be sure to specify that you wish to preserve the directory structure when you unzip the files.


-----------------
File organization
-----------------
The source code for each sample can be found in the VisualStudio####\Source\Chapter## sub-folder, where #### is the version of Visual Studio and ## is the number of the chapter. 

To conserve space, only source files are provided. You can create the binaries by loading the solution files into Visual Studio and building the applications.

Some folders contain ReadMe.txt files that contain additional information about building that particular example.


------------------------------
Visual Studio 2002 versus 2003
------------------------------
You'll notice that all of the code is duplicated under subfolders for Visual Studio 2002 (with .NET Framework 1.0) and Visual Studio 2003 (with .NET Framework 1.1). This is to allow you to open each sample solution using either Visual Studio 2002 or Visual Studio 2003. This approach is necessary because it's quite likely that many readers might not yet have upgraded to Visual Studio 2003, and unfortunately Microsoft decided to make Visual Studio 2003 solutions incompatible with Visual Studio 2002.

So to load a solution into Visual Studio 2003 and have it use version 1.1 of the .NET Framework, use the solution contained under the "VisualStudio2003" folder. 

To load the same solution into Visual Studio 2002 and have it use version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, use the solution contained under the "VisualStudio2002" folder.

Web applications
----------------
Please read the individual ReadMe.txt files contained in their respective folders for important information on creating and configuring the web applications discussed in chapters 8 and 9 of this book.
