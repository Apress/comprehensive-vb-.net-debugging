To setup the AspNetDebugDemo application on your IIS web server, use
IIS to create a IIS virtual directory called AspNetDebugDemo_2002, 
pointing at the real folder C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\AspNetDebugDemo_2002.
This real folder should have been created when you un-zipped
the zip file containing the source code.

Then in Visual Studio 2002, load the AspNetDebugDemo solution.
