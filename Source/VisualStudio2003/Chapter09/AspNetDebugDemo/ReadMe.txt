To setup the AspNetDebugDemo application on your IIS web server, 
use IIS to create a IIS virtual directory called AspNetDebugDemo, 
pointing at the real folder C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\AspNetDebugDemo.
This real folder should have been created when you un-zipped
the zip file containing the source code.

Then in Visual Studio 2003, load the AspNetDebugDemo solution.
